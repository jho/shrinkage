Python scripts to shrink down movies from your iPhone and save space on your hard drive.

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.7.x

Usage
-----

1. Clone the source into any directory

2. Backup your videos!!!!  (This script is very experimental and barely tested)

3. Use all your newly regained hard drive space.

Use cron to run this script weekly to keep your library small.
