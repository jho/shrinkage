Python scripts to shrink down movies from your iPhone and save space on your hard drive.

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.7.x

Usage
-----

1. Clone the source into any directory

2. Backup your videos!!!!  (This script is very experimental and barely tested)

Use cron to run this script weekly to keep your library small.
